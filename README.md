## 100 days of agents

### Background
Every startup, VC, and their moms has a take on "wHaT is aGeNtIC aI?". 
The questions are ill-formed, FOMO-driven, and even as a professional who has been doing ML and AI engineering for a nearly a decade I find myself eminently confused. 

This repository is a personal learning expedition.

| May 22, 2025 | OpenAI AgentSDK | The AgentSDK is OpenAI's latest framework. It is the "production-grade" version of [Swarm](https://github.com/openai/swarm/tree/main), one of their previous projects built on wrapping their model APIs with agents. Primitives are **agents**, **handoffs*, and **guardrails**. |
| May 23, 2025 | Apply OpenAI AgentSDK | I tried and failed to apply the AgentSDK to a data understanding and collection task. I gave up very fast because it was slowing me down and I am tired and want to go to bed. The report was great and it generated syntactically correct Python samples for downloading data, but they were not very helpful. Quicker to write by hand or prompt ChatGPT directly by a lot. |
